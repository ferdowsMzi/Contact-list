# About The Results

I tackled this frontend challenge and got the main functionality working! The app does what it's supposed to do and covers the key requirements I was given.

I tried to set this up the right way from the start. I focused on creating a proper folder structure that could actually scale if needed. I tried to follow clean code principles and make sure I implemented all the task requirements correctly.

For data storage, I went with localStorage. And for managing shared data across different components, I used React's Context API, which fits the project's scope instead of Redux or Jotai.

## Things to Fix & Improve:
- Better Fonts to look more professional or beautiful
- Dark Mode Implementation
- Storage Issues related to syncing local storage and the app
- Error Messages to show using sth like toast
- Profile Photos Handling
- Adding animations and transitions to feel way more polished
- Scalability and Modularity
