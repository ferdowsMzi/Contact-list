I tackled this frontend challenge and got the main functionality working! The app does what it's supposed to do and covers the key requirements I was given.

##Things to Fix & Improve:##
The Stuff That's Bugging Me
Better Fonts to look more professional or beautiful
Dark Mode Implementation
Storage Issues related to syncing local storage and the app
Error Messages to show using sth like toast
Profile Photos Handling
Adding animations and transitions to feel way more polished
Scalability and Modularity
